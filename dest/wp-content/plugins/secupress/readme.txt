== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does SecuPress do, exactly? =
SecuPress is a plugin for WordPress sites which enables better securisation and simplicity of use.

SecuPress will initially offer to scan your site, looking for flaws and possible improvements. Then a report will detail the results of each test and automatically propose to apply solutions. The majority of these criteria can be secured with one-click, some require you to make a choice, and a very few of them will ask for your manual intervention by following our documentation.

Additional security modules are then available to round off certain items according to your needs.

= What makes SecuPress better than any other security plugin? =
SecuPress incorporates many of the most awaited security features: Anti spam, Double authentication.

Besides being very complete, SecuPress is also very simple to use for the beginners.

You don’t need to be an experienced technician to use and configure our plugin.

We have our own security alarm on our servers which supplies daily data about the most recent vulnerable plugins and themes. This allows you to always be alerted and secured.

= Is SecuPress compatible with other security plugins like WordFence, iThemes Security, Bullet Proof Security? =
No, SecuPress can't be compatible, like you can't install two caching plugins. The reason is that each plugin will try to block something, add security rules and at a moment they will overwrite each other. These rules can create a conflict and lead to errors on your website.

It's important to delete all other security plugins before activating SecuPress. If you're not sure, do not hasitate to ask us on twitter, fabeook, support.
